    ///     notification from being sent multiple times in case the trigger event is inadvertently called more than once. By
    ///     leveraging the transactionId, you can make idempotent requests, which means if the same transactionId is used in
    ///     another request, Novuâ€™s API will recognize it and will not send the same notification again.
