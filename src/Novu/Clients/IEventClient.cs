///     The event client is the only way to send notifications to subscribers. The trigger identifier is used to
///     match the particular workflow associated with it. Additional information can be passed according to the body

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     The transactionId within Novu is a unique identifier used to ensure the idempotent nature of notification
///     delivery. When you trigger an event to send a notification, you can provide a transactionId. If you do not
///     provide one, Novu will generate a UUID for you. This identifier is particularly useful for preventing the same
///     notification from being sent multiple times in case the trigger event is inadvertently called more than once. By
///     leveraging the transactionId, you can make idempotent requests, which means if the same transactionId is used in
///     another request, Novuâ€™s API will recognize it and will not send the same notification again.
