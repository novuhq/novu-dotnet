.NET SDK for Novu - The open-source notification infrastructure for engineers. ðŸš€

novu-dotnet targets .NET Standard 2.0 and is compatible with .NET Core 2.0+ and .NET Framework 4.6.1+.

**Current:** Novu api 0.24.0

## Features

- Bindings against all [API endpoints](https://docs.novu.co/api/overview/)
    - Events, subscribers, notifications, integrations, layouts, topics, workflows, workflow groups, messages, execution
      details
- Bootstrap each services as part of services provider or directly as a singleton class (setting injectable)
- A Sync service that will mirror an environment based a set of templates (layouts, integrations, workflow groups,
  workflows)

**WARNING**: 0.3.0 has breaking changes and the tests should be relied on for understanding the client libraries

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package Novu
```

## Configuration

### Direct instantiation

```csharp
using Novu.Domain.Models;
using Novu;

 var novuConfiguration = new NovuClientConfiguration
{
    // Defaults to https://api.novu.co/v1
    Url = "https://novu-api.my-domain.com/v1",
    ApiKey = "12345",
};

var novu = new NovuClient(novuConfiguration);

// Note: this client exposes all endpoints as methods but uses RestService
var subscribers = await novu.Subscriber.Get();
```

### Dependency Injection

Configure via settings

```appsettings.json
{
  "Novu": {
    "Url": "http://localhost:3000/v1",
    "ApiKey": "e36b820fcc9a68a83db6c79c30f1a461"
  }
}

```

Setup Injection via extension methods

```csharp

public static IServiceCollection RegisterNotificationSetupServices(
    this IServiceCollection services,
    IConfiguration configuration)
{
    // registers all clients with novu config from appsetting.json
    // the services inject HttpClient
    return services
        .RegisterNovuClients(configuration)
        // here as an example that the registered services are injected into local service
        .AddTransient<NovuNotificationService>();
}
```

Write your consuming code with the injected clients

```csharp
// then instantiate via injection
public class NovuNotificationService
{
    private readonly IEventClient _event;

    public NovuSyncService(IEventClient @event)
    {
        _event = @event;
    }

    public async Task Trigger(string subscriberId){
       var trigger = await Event.Trigger(
            new EventCreateData
            {
                EventName = 'event-name',
                To = { SubscriberId =subscriberId },
                Payload = new Payload("Bogus payload"),
            });
    }

    public record Payload(string Message)
    {
        [JsonProperty("message")] public string Message { get; set; }
    }
}
```

## Examples

Usage of the library is best understood by looking at the tests.

- [Integration Tests](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Tests/IntegrationTests): these show the
  minimal dependencies required to do one primary request (create, update, delete)
- [Acceptance Tests](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Tests/AcceptanceTests): these show a
  sequence of actions to complete a business process in an environment

## Repository Overview

[Novu](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu) is the main SDK
with [Novu.Tests](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Tests) housing all unit
tests. [Novu.Extensions](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Extensions) is required for DI
and [Novu.Sync](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Sync)
if your are looking for mirroring environments.

### novu-dotnet

The key folders to look into:

- [Models](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu.Domain/Models) directory holds all objects needed to
  use the
  clients (a port of the contracts from openapi spec and consolidatedâ€”actually
  autogen [contracts](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/refitter))
- [Clients](https://github.com/novuhq/novu-dotnet/tree/main/src/Novu/Clients) directory holds all interfaces that
  are intended to outline how a class should be structured

## API

Note: all old release information is in `specs/[version]/README` (which includes diffs)

**Tracking Versions**: `New`, `Changed`, `Deleted`, `Deprecated`

* **New**: tracked since version
* **Changed**: has had changes on the endpoint attributes
* **Deleted**: was removed (obsolete)
* **Deprecated**: marked as being removed

**Compatability**: `Full`, `Incomplete`, `None`, `Upgrade`

* **Full**: all attributes are supported on the model on the method/endpoint call
* **None**: the method/endpoint is not implemented
* **Upgrade**: known changes to the attributes are required that are flagged (practically same as incomplete but
  effectively a NEW placeholder)

### Events

Events represent a change in state of a subscriber. They are used to trigger workflows, and enable you to send
notifications to subscribers based on their actions.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                           | Description            | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|--------|---------|---------|------------|---------------|-------|
| POST        | /v1/events/trigger                 | Trigger event          | 0.18.0 | 0.19.0  |         |            | Upgrade       |       |
| POST        | /v1/events/trigger/bulk            | Bulk trigger event     | 0.18.0 |         |         |            | Full          |       |
| POST        | /v1/events/trigger/broadcast       | Broadcast event to all | 0.18.0 |         |         |            | Full          |       |
| DELETE      | /v1/events/trigger/{transactionId} | Cancel triggered event | 0.18.0 |         |         |            | Full          |       |

### Subscribers

A subscriber in Novu represents someone who should receive a message. A subscriberâ€™s profile information contains
important attributes about the subscriber that will be used in messages (name, email). The subscriber object can contain
other key-value pairs that can be used to further personalize your messages.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                          | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Topics

Topics are a way to group subscribers together so that they can be notified of events at once. A topic is identified by
a custom key. This can be helpful for things like sending out marketing emails or notifying users of new features.
Topics can also be used to send notifications to the subscribers who have been grouped together based on their
interests, location, activities and much more.

### Notification

A notification conveys information from source to recipient, triggered by a workflow acting as a message blueprint.
Notifications can be individual or bundled as digest for user-friendliness.

### Integrations

With the help of the Integration Store, you can easily integrate your favorite delivery provider. During the runtime of
the API, the Integrations Store is responsible for storing the configurations of all the providers.

### Layouts

Novu allows the creation of layouts - a specific HTML design or structure to wrap content of email notifications.
Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new or existing workflows within the Novu platform, allowing users to create,
manage, and assign these layouts to workflows, so they can be reused to structure the appearance of notifications sent
through the platform.

### Workflows

All notifications are sent via a workflow. Each workflow acts as a container for the logic and blueprint that are
associated with a type of notification in your system.

### Changes

Changes represent a change in state of an environment. They are analagous to a pending pull request in git, enabling you
to test changes before they are applied to your environment and atomically apply them when you are ready.

### Environments

Novu uses the concept of environments to ensure logical separation of your data and configuration. This means that
subscribers, and preferences created in one environment are never accessible to another.

| HTTP Method | Endpoint                             | Description             | New    | Changed | Deleted | Deprecated | Compatability | Notes |

### Tenants

A tenant represents a group of users. As a developer, when your apps have organizations, they are referred to as
tenants. Tenants in Novu provides the ability to tailor specific notification experiences to users of different groups
or organizations.

### Messages

A message in Novu represents a notification delivered to a recipient on a particular channel. Messages contain
information about the request that triggered its delivery, a view of the data sent to the recipient, and a timeline of
its lifecycle events. Learn more about messages.

### Organizations

An organization serves as a separate entity within your Novu account. Each organization you create has its own separate
integration store, workflows, subscribers, and API keys. This separation of resources allows you to manage multi-tenant
environments and separate domains within a single account.
